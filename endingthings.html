				<p style="font-size: 24px;">I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid</p>

				<p>
					This novel can best be categorized as a psychological thriller, but the elements intertwined throughout the entirety reads more as a work of horror.  This unnerving storyline follows a couple going to visit the boyfriend's parents, which takes them on an ominous snowy drive to an eerie farmhouse and then ultimately to an abandoned school.  This book is packed with suspenseful scenes and confusion surrounding our unreliable narrator, but the twists and turns will leave you shocked.  This novel goes against the normality of typical horror and can be left up to any interpretation.  If youâ€™re looking for a disorienting read that will leave you scared, mystified, and in an altered state of mind, this book is perfect for you.</p>
