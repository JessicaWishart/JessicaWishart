				<p>Schedule aside 10 minutes of free time for reading each day.  Allotting yourself this time will help keep you responsible for your reading and you will eventually work it into a habit that will increase over time.</p>

				<p>Don’t set unrealistic goals.  Figure out how much you want to read and don’t put pressure on yourself.  Remember, reading is all for fun and shouldn’t turn into an internal competition.</p>

				<p>Find a reading nook that fits your needs.  Finding a space that is the perfect environment or atmosphere for you to succeed at reading is key.  Figure out where you read best and stick to it.</p>

				<p>Choose books that you actually enjoy.  Don’t force yourself to read a book that doesn’t pique your interest or else reading will seem like a chore.  Do some research and explore the genres that genuinely intrigue you.</p>
