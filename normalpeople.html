				<p style="font-size: 24px;">Normal People by Sally Rooney</p>

				<p>
					This book is a fascinating, untraditional love story between Marianne and Connell set in Ireland.  These two characters face challenges and struggles throughout their high school and college careers, yet they always seem to find a way back to each other.  Their relationship is messy, angsty, and above all else, painfully realistic to modern day dating.  If you’re looking for a raw, emotional novel that highlights the trials and tribulations of dating through miscommunication, jealousy, and class, then I would highly recommend this.  Ranked one of my highest reads of 2021, you won’t regret going on this tumultuous journey through heartbreak and young love.
